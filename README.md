# PurpleKnightReportAutomation
This is a script I wrote in VBA to automate adding and formatting PurpleKnight reports (an Active Directory audit tool) into an Excel Workbook.

Bear with me it's my first time using VBA I'm no business school student.

ps: the autofit function makes excel crash sometimes so make backups
